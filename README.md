# Weather Image Classification
Dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4drtyfjtfy/1

This project aims to classify weather images into four categories: rain, cloudy, shine, and sunrise. The dataset consists of 1125 images stored in a folder named weatherData. The images are labeled according to their filenames (e.g., rain1, cloudy2, shine3, etc.). We use a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and a Random Forest classifier for classification. The current model achieves an accuracy of 72%.
